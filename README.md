# AI Learning Assistant

This prototype explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance education by offering a personalized and adaptive learning experience. The LLM complements an instructor's role by providing tailored feedback, identifying knowledge gaps, and recommending targeted resources to students. This approach resonates with the core principles of personalized education, transforming the learning experience into a journey of self-discovery and growth.

1. `/cdk`: Contains the deployment code for the app's AWS infrastructure
    - `/bin`: Contains the instantiation of CDK stack
    - `/data_ingestion`: Contains the code required for the Data Ingestion step in retrieval-augmented generation. This folder is used by a Lambda function that runs a container which updates the vectorstore for a course when files are uploaded or deleted.
    - `/lambda`: Contains the lambda functions for the project
    - `/layers`: Contains the required layers for lambda functions
    - `/lib`: Contains the deployment code for all infrastructure stacks
    - `/text_generation`: Contains the code required for the Text Generation step in retrieval-augmented generation. This folder is used by a Lambda function that runs a container which retrieves specific documents and invokes the LLM to generate appropriate responses during a conversation.
2. `/docs`: Contains documentation for the application
3. `/frontend`: Contains the user interface of the application
    - `/public`: public assets used in the application
    - `/src`: contains the frontend code of the application
