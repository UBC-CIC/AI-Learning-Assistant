## Administrator View
To sign up as an administrator, you need to sign up regularly first as a student:

You then get a confirmation email to verify your email. Once you have a student account, to become an adminstrator, you need to change your user group with Cognito through the AWS Console:

Clicking the "CREATE NEW MODULE" button leads to a page where the instructor can create a module. The module's name can be specified here along with the concept it belongs to. The instructor can then upload files to this module from their device. `PDF`, `DOCX`, `PPTX`, `TXT`, `XLSX`, `XPS`, `MOBI`, and `CBZ` file types are supported. The "SAVE MODULE" button here saves the module:

Clicking the "EDIT" button beside a course leads to a page similar to creating a module. The module's name and concept can be changed here. The instructor can also remove previous files from the module while adding new ones. Each file in the module can be downloaded on the instructor's device. The "SAVE MODULE" button here saves the changes made to the module and the "DELETE MODULE" deletes the entire module:

## Student View
Upon logging in as an student, they see the following home page:
![image](./images/student-home-page.png)

We are going to be looking at the CPSC 210 course as an example. Upon selecting CPSC 210, the student is shown a list of concepts at the top: Basics, Abstraction, Construction, and Design. Within each concept, there are several modules. For example, the Basics concept has the Program Structure, Methods And Calls, Classes, and Data Flow modules:
![image](./images/student-modules.png)

If we click the "Review" button beside the Program Structure module, we are taken to a page where an LLM asks us a question and creates a new conversation:
![image](./images/student-new-conversation.png)

The student can then answer the questions the LLM asks in a conversation manner. Upon answering multiple questions correctly, the LLM determines when the student has achieved competency over the module:
![image](./images/student-conversation-1.png)
![image](./images/student-conversation-2.png)

Upon going back to the list of modules in this course, the student can see their learning journey as the module they achieved competency for is complete. The concept that module belonged to has also slightly changed in color by going from an inital red color to orange:
![image](./images/student-complete-module.png)

After completing more modules, the concept those modules belongs to gradually changes color to show the student's learning journey:
